# Password_Gen
A password generator -- home work # 3

Jim Denis --- Home Work 3 --- Date 02/06/20 

Created a JavaScript program to generate a password for the user. They must respond to a prompt to say how long their password should be. It must be between 8 & 128 characters long. They will have 5 attempts to get it right. If they don't get it right after the 5th attempt, they will be nicely booted off the system. Assuming a good password length, they will then be prompted for the type of characters they would like to be included in their password. Their will chose from capital letters,small letters, numbers & special chars. They must chose one of these. If they do not once again they are nicely booted off the system. If they chose one or more the password will then be generated. 

you should be able to find the screens on...
